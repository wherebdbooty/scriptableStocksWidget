This is a large-sized scriptable widget that lists multiple stock widgets based on Yahoo's webpage. It can show price, change, or chart.
It will auto-resize the squares based on how many stocks are listed.

Use the "substitution list" array to modify how the stock symbols are shown. If no substitution is found, it will show the original symbol.

Change the "gradient" variables to modify how the green/red colors are shown.
